# presentationValidator

`presentationValidator` takes your `.pptx` presentations or image files and analyzes them using an LLM to deliver a detailed report on **consistency, accuracy, and quality** — along with **suggestions for improvement**.

---

## ✨ Features
- Accepts **PowerPoint presentations** (`.pptx`) or **images** (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`).
- Generates AI-driven error-checking and improvement suggestions.
- Detects inconsistencies and formatting issues.
- Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- Console-friendly output with structured formatting.
- Scalability Mode: For large presentations (20+ slides), the system automatically pre-processes slides with an LLM to extract only the most important details — reducing token usage while maintaining all essential meaning for accurate analysis.
